About EllipsisUI
=====================================

EllipsisUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi, a media playback application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with EllipsisUI is to resurrect the Ellipsis project from Team Blackbolt. 
The original goal for Ellipsis was to make the navigation and use of Kodi as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can.
This UI sounds addon was created using sound assets ripped from Ellipsis by Team Blackbolt.
