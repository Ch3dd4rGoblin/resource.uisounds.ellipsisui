About EllipsisUI
=====================================

EllipsisUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi, a media playback application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with EllipsisUI is to resurrect the Ellipsis project from Team Blackbolt. 
The original goal for Ellipsis was to make the navigation and use of Kodi as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can.
This UI sounds addon was created using sound assets ripped from Ellipsis by Team Blackbolt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install and use EllipsisUI UI sounds addon using Kodi:
====================================

Copy the 'resource.uisounds.ellipsisui' folder that is found in the zip file to your Kodi/addons/ directory.
This folder may be different depending where you installed to. When you have copied go over to Kodi and then select Addons/My Addons/Look amd Feel/GUI Sounds, then select EllipsisUI UI Sounds 

You may also install direct from within Kodi's addon manager.
